			<h4>The population of critically endangered North Atlantic right whales continues to dwindle, sparking concerns that the species might be creeping closer to extinction.

A newly released estimate suggests that only 340 individuals of the species Eubalaena glacialis remained as of 2021, a 2.3% decline from 2020, when the population numbered around 348. This estimate is also in sharp contrast with the 2010 calculation of about 483 individuals.

“With this new population estimate, the species number is now down to what it was around 2001,” Philip Hamilton, senior scientist at the New England Aquarium and a member of the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium, a group of experts dedicated to the protection of the species, said in a statement. In the 10 years since that 2001 low, Hamilton said the population “increased by 150 whales.”

“[T]hat tells us this species can recover if we stop injuring and killing them,” he said.</h4>
